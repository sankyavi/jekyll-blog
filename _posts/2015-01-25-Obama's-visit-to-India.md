#OBAMA’S VISIT: EXPECTATIONS


First thing first, the real immediate impact of Mr. Obama’s visit to India was that as many as 15000 CCTV cameras were installed in Delhi and the city of Agra was cleaned thoroughly, please Mr. President make announcement that you wish to take a dip in Ganga, then the river will be cleaned for sure.

Indo-US ties in the cold war era as not really warm, with US siding with Pakistan, India’s regional rivals back then. But after India opened up its economy the 90’s and the rapid growth of Indian middle class, the US realised that India is too large a market to ignore and Pakistan can be slowly ignored. So Indo-US engagements started to become more frequent affair. Now let’s see the importance of this visit by the president of USA.

1.	India can Counter balance China’s growth (Something that will work favourably for the US)

2.	Given the quality of arms imported from Russia, India would like to look for other seller’s in the arms market, this is something US will look into.

3.	With a resurgent India trying to have a say in the global affairs, intelligence sharing is something that will be taken seriously.

4.	Economic ties will be looked into, given the US’s frustration with the Intellectual property protection in India and the limited access to the Indian market. Given that generic medicines made by Indian pharmaceutical companies is essential for the poorer population of the world, it very unlikely that India will make any compromiseson the patent rules though American companies may get broader access to the market.

5.	Mr. Modi and Mr. Obama both being advocate of renewable energy, it is one area where progress should be made with India wanting more investment from the American companies in India. The civil nuclear deal will also be an important point of discussion.

Whatever may be the final outcome of the visit, it making the right noises and the sight of leader of the two biggest democracies in the world smiling over a cup of coffee would make any believer of democracy happy.
